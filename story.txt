This is Harry. He was born in Shanghai. When he was 13, his family moved to
Vermont. When he was 15, his family moved to Wisconsin.

At the age of 23, he moved to Nepal, tired of being surrounded by people. Few people have heard from him since. Society has seemed to have forgotten 
him. However, unbeknownst to him, just a couple months after his departure, a child of his was born. He did not know of the existence of this child, 
but that would soon change.

It all started with the letter. No return address, and a sloppily written label meant Harry was perplexed by the delivery, but the contents would
prove to be even more confusing to him. Simply reading "Hi Dad, I'm coming to find you soon", the letter freaked Harry out to say the least. Was this his imagination?
Acutally, as it turns out, it was a prank letter send by a scam company to see if the address they send was valid. But Harry didnt know this, Harry thought that something bigger was going on. He couldn't imagine where a mystery kid would have come from, let alone why they would try to find him. Nevertheless, Harry knew that any child of his would be able to find him in the remote mountains of Nepal, so he simply decided to wait, And wait he did...
Many years later, he heard a door knock, it was his son; It was a young man in his twenties, and before Harry was able to speak, the young man said:" This is the United States government, and an arrest warrent has been placed under your name, if you dont...." Harry closed his door and returned to his cup of coffee.
