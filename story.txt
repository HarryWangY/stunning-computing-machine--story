This is Harry. He was born in Shanghai. When he was 13, his family moved to
Vermont. When he was 15, his family moved to Wisconsin.

At the age of 23, he moved to Nepal, tired of being surrounded by people. Few people have heard from him since. Society has seemed to have forgotten 
him. However, unbeknownst to him, just a couple months after his departure, a child of his was born. He did not know of the existence of this child, 
but that would soon change.

It all started with the letter. No return address, and a sloppily written label meant Harry was perplexed by the delivery, but the contents would
prove to be even more confusing to him. Simply reading "Hi Dad, I'm coming to find you soon", the letter freaked Harry out to say the least. Was this
the act of a crazy stalker? A legitimate child? Or was his isolation finally driving him insane?
